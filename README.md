# SafeGuardAI
This project implements an AI-based autonomous threat detection system.

Due to system constraints, Android is treated as a deployment layer.
The full intelligence pipeline is implemented, tested, and validated
in a platform-neutral backend simulator.

Android integration is documented and architecture-complete.
